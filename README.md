# PROBABILISTIC ROBUSTNESS IN THE GAP METRIC
This repository contains the code to simulate Probabilistic Robust Control Using Gap Metric

 **Associated Paper:** Venkatraman Renganathan, `Probabilistic Robustness in the Gap Metric`, Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 2025.

## Dependencies
- Matlab

## Information about code
There are three main coding files:
1. `probabilisticGapGuarantees.m` 
2. `probabilisticGapRobustStability.m`
3. `probabilisticGapScenarioRobustness.m`

## Steps to Run the Code 
1. While running any of the above three coding files, set the parameters of the nominal plant and nominal controller accordingly
2. Similarly set the distribution information (mean, standard deviation, covariance) about the parameter theta.
3. Find the interested quantity and compare it against the lower/upper bound from the theory in the paper.
